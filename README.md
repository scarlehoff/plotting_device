# Plotting device

A library for (beautiful?)-(gnuplotlike?) plots using matplotlib, so I can use jupyter notebooks with it

------

The plan was to have something I can use in a quick&dirty way together with jupyter notebooks to show plots during presentations or lectures.
For that I needed some plotting styles that were only available (as far as I know) in gnuplot, namely boxxyerrorbars so I have added them to matplotlib in the most general way I could think of.

Also, taking ratios of two plots in gnuplot is a pain so I added a plot_1/plot_2 division method to the Plot class.

I don't know whether I will ever update this, but feel free to use it if it happens to be useful for you and ask me any questions you could have.

Happy plotting!
